\begin{problem}[\textcolor{red}{Closed Walks in $K_n$}]
    Find a combinatorial proof of the fact that $\#$ closed walks of length $l$ in $K_n$ from some vertex to itself is \[\frac{1}{n}\left((n-1)^l+(n-1)(-1)^l\right)\]
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
    We'll count the number of closed $l$-walks from $v_1$ to $v_1$, which, by symmetry, is the number of closed $l$-walks from any vertex to itself. We write each walk as an ordered list of vertices, so that we must find the number of walks \[v_1,v_{i_1},v_{i_2},\cdots,v_{i_{l-1}},v_1,\] where $v_{i_1}\neq v_1$, $v_{i_{l-1}}\neq v_1$, and $v_{i_k}\neq v_{i_{k+1}}$ for all $1\leq k\leq l-2$. We count starting with $(n-1)^l$, or the number of $l-1$-walks starting with $v_1$: each subsequent vertex is distinct from the preceding one, for $n-1$ options. However, we overcount by the number of sequences where $v_{i_{l-1}}=v_1$, which is the number of closed $l-1$-walks
    \footnote{This suggests that we could complete via an inductive proof, using \[(n-1)^{l}-\frac{1}{n}\left((n-1)^{l-1}+(n-1)(-1)^{l-1}\right)=\frac{1}{n}\left((n-1)^{l}+(n-1)(-1)^l\right).\]}. 
    The idea is that we take any $l-1$-walk, and make our next step $v_1$, but we need to subtract the closed $l-1$ walks, which would make our final step impossible. Repeating the same reasoning, we can find the number of closed $l-1$-walks by taking $(n-1)^{l-1}$ and then subtracting the number of closed $l-2$-walks. In this way, and finishing with $n-1$ $2$-walks, the number of closed $l$-walks from a vertex to itself is
    \begin{align*}
        &(n-1)^{l-1}-(n-1)^{l-2}+(n-1)^{l-3}+\cdots+(-1)^l(n-1)\\
        &=\sum_{k=1}^{l-1}(n-1)^k(-1)^{l-1+k}\\
        &=(-1)^{l-1}\sum_{k=1}^{l-1}(1-n)^k\\
        &=(-1)^{l-1}\frac{(1-n)\left((1-n)^{l-1}-1\right)}{1-n-1}\\
        &=(-1)^{l}\frac{(1-n)^{l}-(1-n)}{n}\\
        &=\frac{1}{n}\left((n-1)^l+(n-1)(-1)^l\right),
    \end{align*}
    as desired.
\end{proof}

    \end{center}
    \begin{enumerate}[(i)]
        \item Every step on a walk takes us between partites sets $A$ and $B$. Thus, there are no $2l+1$-walks, meaning that \[\sum (\lambda_i)^{2l+1}=0,\] so \[\sum(-\lambda_i)^{2l+1}=-\sum(\lambda_i)^{2l+1}=0=\sum (\lambda_i)^{2l+1}.\] As $\sum(\lambda_i)^{2l}=\sum(-\lambda_i)^{2l}$, $\sum\lambda_i^k$ and $\sum(-\lambda_i)^k$ agree for all positive integers $k$, so the $-\lambda_i$ are simply a permutation of the $\lambda_i$, meaning that all nonzero eigenvalues come in $\pm\lambda$ pairs.

                pair A1,A2,A3,B1,B2,B3;
                A1 = (-5,3);
                A2 = (-5,0);
                A3 = (-5,-3);
                B1 = (5,3);
                B2 = (5,3);
                B3 = (5,-3);

                dot(A1); dot(A2); dot(A3); dot(B1); dot(B2); dot(B3);
            \end{asy}
        \end{center}
        \item Call the partite with $r$ elements $A$ and the partite with $s$ elements $B$. If $l$ is odd, there are zero walks. So, we assume $l$ is even. If we begin our $l$-walk in $A$, we know go from $A$ to $B$ $l$ times and $B$ to $A$ $l$ times. Each time we go from $A$ to $B$, we have $s$ options. Each time we go from $B$ to $A$, we have $r$ options, except the last step, at which point we must return to our original vertex, for which we have $r$ choices. There are thus $s^{l}r^{l-1}r=(rs)^l$ $l$-walks beginning in $A$, and an identical argument gives $(rs)^l$ $l$-walks beginning in $B$. There are thus \[\begin{cases}0&l\equiv1\pmod{2}\\2(rs)^l&l\equiv0\pmod{2}\end{cases}\] $l$-walks.
        \item $\sum\lambda_i^l$ and $(rs)^l+(-rs)^l+(n-2)\cdot(0)^l$ agree for all positive $l$, so the eigenvalues of $K_{r,s}$ are \[\pm rs,0\text{ }(r+s-2\text{ times}).\]
        We now consider the $K_{n,n}-nK_2$ graph, providing $n=3$ as an example:
        \begin{center}
            \begin{asy}
                size(3cm);
                draw(ellipse((-5,0),2,5));
                draw(ellipse((5,0),2,5));
                label("$A$",(-5,-7));
                label("$B$",(5,-7));
                pair A1,A2,A3,B1,B2,B3;
                A1 = (-5,3);
                A2 = (-5,0);
                A3 = (-5,-3);
                B1 = (5,3);
                B2 = (5,0);
                B3 = (5,-3);
                draw(A1--B1,dashed+red);draw(A1--B2);draw(A1--B3);
                draw(A2--B1);draw(A2--B2,dashed+red);draw(A2--B3);
                draw(A3--B1);draw(A3--B3,dashed+red);draw(A3--B2);
                dot(A1); dot(A2); dot(A3); dot(B1); dot(B2); dot(B3);
            \end{asy}
        \end{center}
        \item We aim to find the number of $l$-walks (for even $l$) on $K_{n,n}-nK_2$. If we write the partites as $a_1,a_2,\cdots, a_n$ and $b_1,b_2,\cdots,b_n$ such that the $a_i$ and $b_i$ are not connected, but $a_i$ and $b_j$ for $i\neq j$ are connected, then our walk-counting problem becomes analogous to the $K_n$ problem. Any valid will alternate between $A$ and $B$, but have \textit{no index repeated twice in a row}. That is, $a_1b_2$ is a valid step, while $a_1b_1$ is not. We can use this to establish an bijection between $l$-walks starting in $A$ and $l$-walks on $K_n$, meaning that the \textit{total} number of $l$-walks on $K_{n,n}-nK_2$ is \[2n\left(\frac{1}{n}\left((n-1)^l+(n-1)(-1)^l\right)\right)=2(n-1)^l+2(n-1)(-1)^l.\] For odd $l$, the number of walks is clearly $0$, and so $\sum\lambda_i^l$ agrees for all positive $l$ with \[(n-1)^l+(1-n)^l+(n-1)((-1)^l+(1)^l),\] meaning that our eigenvalues are \[\pm 1(n-1\text{ times}),\pm(n-1)\text{(once each)}.\]

\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
    \item Let $G$ be a graph with max degree $\Delta(G)$. Let $\lambda_1$ be the largest eigenvalue of $A(G)$. Show that $\lambda_1\leq\Delta(G)$.
    \item Let $G$ be a simple graph with $m$ edges. Show that $\lambda_1\leq \sqrt{2m}$.

\begin{problem}
\phantom{0}
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
    \item Start with $n$ coins heads up. Choose a coin at random and turn it over. Do this a total of $m$ times.
    \item Same as (i), except now compute the probability that all coins have tails up.
    \item Same as (i), but now we turn over two coins at a time.
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}[Solution]
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
    \item By writing the chain of coins as a string of ones and zeros (where a zero corresponds to a tail), each flip changes exactly one digit. We can thus view the process of $m$ flips as an $m$-walk on an $n$-dimensional hypercube, making our probability \[\frac{\#\text{ closed }m-\text{walks from a given vertex to itself}}{\#m-\text{walks starting at a given vertex}},\]which is also \[\frac{\#\text{closed }m-\text{walks}}{\#m-\text{walks}}\text{ on }K_2^n.\]
\end{enumerate}
\end{proof}
