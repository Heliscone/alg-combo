\begin{problem}[\textcolor{red}{Random Walks on $\mathbb{Z}$}]
    Consider a random walk on $\mathbb{Z}$ where we start at 0 and move from $i$ to $i + 1$ or $i - 1$ with equal probability.

    \begin{enumerate}[(i)]
        \item Prove that we eventually return to 0 with probability 1.
        \item Compute $a_i$ explicitly and conclude that
        \[
            \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{a_n}{2_n} = 1
        \]

        What is the sequence ${a_n}$ called in Math literature?
        \item Prove that each number n is visited at least once with probability 1.
        \item Let $H_n$ denote the expected \# steps needed to reach $n$ for the first time. What is wrong with the
        following argument?
        We claim that $H_n = cn$ for some constant $c$. This is true for $n = 0$. So let $n > 0$. On the average, we need $H_1$ steps to reach 1, and then $H_{n-1}$ steps to reach n starting from 1. Hence
        \[
            H_n = 1 + H_{n-1} = c + c(n-1) = cn ; H_1 = c
        \]
    \end{enumerate}

\begin{problem}[\textcolor{red}{Some examples of Hitting times}]
    \begin{enumerate}[(i)]
        \item Find the hitting time between any two vertices of $K_n$.
        \item Find the hitting time between the endpoints of $P_n$ (a path on $n$ vertices).
        \item Find the hitting time between an endpoint of $P_n$ and a vertex at distance $k$ from it.
        \item Find the hitting time between two vertices of $C_n$ (cycle of $n$ vertices) at distance $k$.
